#  Manners Group Research Project: 
## Living anionic polymerisations of PFS metallopolymers and self-assembly.

* 

Preparation of 2D nano-particles for liquid crystalline applications by CDSA. This involved Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), SEM, MALDI, GPC, NMR and glove-box use with highly air-sensitive living anionic polymerisations. This work involved generating self-assembled monodisperse polyferrocenylsilane hexagonal platelets with block copolymer coronas and packing them to form Smectic A liquid crystals analysed by POM, SAXS and WAXS.

### Programming

Developed an image processing application for automating measurements of nanoparticle disc diameters on electron microscope images with Python and opencv.
