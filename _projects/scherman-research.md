# Scherman Group Research Project: 
## Organic synthesis of supramolecular hyperbranched gels with cucurbiturils.

* Macrocycle functionalisation with thiolene click reactions and purification.

Developed a novel supramolecular hyperbranched polymer with host-guest chemistry of cucurbiturils. Independently planned and carried out an eight step synthetic pathway with column purification, GPC and NMR analysis at each step. The resultant tri-armed product contained a cucurbituril host arm and two guest arms which slots inside the host cavity of another monomer to form the hyperbranched supramolecular polymer. Independently ran and maintained a mass spectrometer in order to deduce optimum reaction conditions for cucurbituril based thiolene click reactions.

### Programming
