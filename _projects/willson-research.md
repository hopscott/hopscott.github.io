#  Willson Group Research Project: 
## Lactone based photo-resist with directed self-assembly unzipping polymer

* Polymer synthesis and functionalisation for photolithograpy in silicon chip manufacturing.

Developed a directed self assembly “unzipping” block copolymer for use in integrated chip production for the semiconductor industry. This involved the use of clean rooms, spin coating techniques onto silicon wafers, and polymer synthesis and characterisation methods. The project involved polymerisation of lactone monomers to produce polyesters with low ceiling temperatures.  The polymers were endcapped with tBoc groups for selective deprotection.

### Programming

Produced sustainable polymer for photolithography within semiconductor industry through optimisation of surface topography with data analysis.
