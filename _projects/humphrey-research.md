# Humphrey Group Research Project: 
## Project & Publication: Meso/amorphous Co3O4 supports for CuIr nanoparticle catalysts.

* Synthesis of metal alloy nanoparticles catalysts and mesoporous/amorphous metal oxides through hard and soft templating with nanoparticle intergration.

Prepared a variety of different metal alloy nanoparticle catalysts for targeted hydrogenation. CuIr and NiIr nanoparticles were successfully synthesised and analysed with PXRD to provide data on particle size. Metal alloy compositions were determined from XPS-EOS measurements. Magnetic CoIr nanoparticles were prepared for facile catalyst recuperation from chemical reactions, but this proved unsuccessful from PXRD data showing predominantly small pure Ir nanoparticle generation. I also synthesised mesoporous and amorphous Co3O4 catalyst supports and embedded the support with CuIr catalyst for catalysis line trials.
